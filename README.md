### Cloud Architect

| Project Link | Completion Date | Tools | Project Description | 
|---|---|---|---|
| ü§ñ [Language Detection](https://github.com/yvt-ee/MUGC-Language-Detection) | Apr 2024 | Jupiter, FastAPI, Docker, AWS(Amplify, ECS, Lamdba, DynamoDB) | Train the language detection model using Jupiter Notebook, then use FastAPI and Docker to push the image to Docker hub. Build the website front end using AWS Amplify, put the pre-trained model in the ECS and trigger it with Lambda, save the result in DymanoDB for further analysis |

### Python


| Project Link | Completion Date | Tools | Project Description | 
|---|---|---|---|
| üè† [Housing Price Trends](https://github.com/yvt-ee/Data-Mining-in-Engineering/blob/main/%231%20Navigating%20and%20visualizing%20Housing%20dataset.ipynb) | May 2024 | Python(Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn) |The project is about navigating and visualizing the housing data using Python, leveraging libraries like Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn. Explore, clean, visualize, and analysis data effectively. |
| üç∑ [PCA for Wine dataset](https://github.com/yvt-ee/Data-Mining-in-Engineering/blob/main/%232%20PCA%20for%20Wine%20dataset.ipynb) | May 2024 | Python(sklearn) |This project applies PCA, a dimensionality reduction technique, to the Wine dataset to reduce complexity while retaining key information. It leverages scikit-learn to visualize and analyze the chemical properties of different wine varieties. |
| üìà [Linear Regression and Polynomial Regression](https://github.com/yvt-ee/Data-Mining-in-Engineering/blob/main/%236%20Linear%20Regression%20and%20Polynomial%20Regression.ipynb) | May 2024 | Python(sklearn, ipywidgets) |The project explores both linear and polynomial regression models to capture relationships between features and predict outcomes, adapting model complexity to the dataset. |
| üõí [FP-Growth and Apriori Algorithms in market basket analysis](https://github.com/yvt-ee/Data-Mining-in-Engineering/blob/main/%239%20FP-Growth%20and%20Apriori%20Algorithms%20in%20market%20basket%20analysis.ipynb) | Jun 2024 | Python(networkx, ipywidgets) |In this project, frequent itemset mining and association rule learning are implemented using the FP-Growth and Apriori algorithms to uncover patterns in transaction data, commonly applied in recommendation systems and retail analytics.|
| üß† [Detailed exploration of Neural Network](https://github.com/yvt-ee/Data-Mining-in-Engineering/blob/main/%2310%20Detailed%20exploration%20of%20Neural%20Network.ipynb) | Jun 2024 | Python(TensorFlow, Keras) |This interactive simulation project provides an in-depth look at how different neural network architectures and configurations can be used to solve complex problems, using TensorFlow and Keras for deep learning model training and evaluation.|
| üì∞ [Text Analysis on the 20 Newsgroups Dataset](https://github.com/yvt-ee/Data-Mining-in-Engineering/blob/main/%2311%20Text%20Analysis%20on%20the%2020%20Newsgroups%20Dataset.ipynb) | Jun 2024 | Python(nltk) |The project preprocesses and performs sentiment analysis on the "misc.forsale" category from the 20 Newsgroups dataset using the VADER sentiment analysis tool. It highlights the power of NLP in extracting sentiment from unstructured text data.|
